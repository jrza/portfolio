## So my first proper Typescript & Next.js Use Became my Portfolio Website"
It serves as a basic website with some UI elements that I liked to my taste, hope you do aswell!

## What New Features/Changes are Coming?

1. **Quarterly Update Timeline at Minimum**
   - Highlight progression across my experiences & projects
   - Also add new sections altogether to showcase my other avenues & advents
  
2. **Implement a RESTful API for Information Update**
   - Eventually add a workflow for a RESTful API to directly change the data such as projects directly
   - Will avoid need for constant commits and redeployment of main branch
   - Make it easier and more frequent to update information
  
3. **Rework the UI/UX**
   - To further align with my design and feel preferences and likes
   - Further refine the mobile interface
